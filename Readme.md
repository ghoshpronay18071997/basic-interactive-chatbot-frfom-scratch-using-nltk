# **1. Project Description**

- **Natural Language Processing** in **Artificial Intelligence** is the application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech.

- A **chatbot or chatterbot** is a **software application** used to **conduct an on-line chat conversation** via **text or text-to-speech**, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent

- The goal of this project is to develop a **simple interactive chatbot from the scratch.**

- You are working for a **technical start up** who are willing to launch their own chatbot.

- They want you to develop this **in house chatbot**.

 
- The bot should be able to **return responses** for a **given set of input(s)**.

# **2. Approach towards the problem**

- The approach to this project was to make a **chat bot from scratch.**

- Initially all the necessary libraries were imported and installed.

- Then, the data corpus was formed from <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot">here</a>

- A **data corpus** is a collection of linguistic data.

- Then while performing **preprocessing** we used lemitization technique in order to process the data into desirable format.

- After that the **greetings  function** was made

- Then, the **bot responses** were genarated.

# 3. Limitation(s)   
- As because this is a **prototype** this will thorow errors as a bulk amount of data processing is required.

- The **accuracy** of this bot is relatively low as because of **the size of the training data corpus**.

   

# **4. Libraries Used**

Following are the list of **libraries** that were used for making this project.

- **nltk** was used in order to perfom all the natual language processing tasks.  

- **numpy** was used in order to calcucate numercal operations.

-  **WordNetLemmatizer** was used for **text lemitization**

- **wordnet** was used to make the data dictionary

- **punkt** was used to correct the punctuations.

# **5. Summary**
- In this project we have successfully developed a chatbot that can deal with **human responses.**

  

- This can be further tuned to develop a **human handoff** such as **RASA NLU**

  

- As because this is a prototype and the size of the **training data corpus** this chatbot is throwing with low accuracy and can accurately work the data that has been fed.

# **6. Applications**

- This chatbot if trained with a large amount of data can be used as a **general purpose chatbot**.

- Areas such as **BFSI, Retail and Ecommerce** will have a wide range of applications at the time of customer dealing with the help of this chatbot.
